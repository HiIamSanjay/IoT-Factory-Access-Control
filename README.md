# IoT-Factory-Access-Control
An IoT-powered access control system using ESP32, Blynk IoT, and barcode scanning to regulate factory entry. It features stepper motor-controlled gates, a mobile app, and an emergency alert system with LED and buzzer activation.
IoT-Based Factory Access Control System with Mobile Application

This project demonstrates an IoT-powered Factory Access Control System using ESP32, Blynk IoT, and a mobile application. The system automates factory gate access by scanning employee barcodes and controlling stepper motors to open or close gates. It also features an emergency alert system that can be triggered via the mobile app, activating an LED and buzzer.

Features
